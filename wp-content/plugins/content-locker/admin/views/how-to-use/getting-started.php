<p>
	<?php esc_html_e( 'Your content is valuable, and if you do not want your visitors to read everything for free, you should ask for something in return. In the past, this used to be hard cash but over the years, asking for Likes and Shares has been easier and more valuable for webmasters.', 'content-locker' ) ?>
</p>

<p>
	<?php esc_html_e( 'Content Locker hides parts of your content and only allows visitors who give you social votes to see the content. This social vote can be in the form of a Facebook Like, A Tweet, or even a Google +1.', 'content-locker' ) ?>

<h3><?php esc_html_e( '2. Turn Your Visitors into Subscribers', 'content-locker' ) ?></h3>

<p>
	<?php echo wp_kses_post( __( 'If you want your visitors to follow you or Like your page, you can do that with the Content Locker as well. You can even use the "Sign-in Locker" feature to gain the good \'ol subscribers by <strong>getting their email ID, Name</strong> and other info from their social media accounts. The plugin has an option to enable manual email ID and name insertion as well.', 'content-locker' ) ) ?>
</p>

<p>
	<?php esc_html_e( 'The plugin supports integration with MailChimp and MailerLite, with an option to export all the subscribers into a CSV file.', 'content-locker' ) ?>

<p>
	<?php esc_html_e( 'It is not hard to imagine what your traffic will be like if every visitor you get shares your content with their 100+ friends on websites like Facebook or Twitter. One visit will quickly turn into 100 and 100 will turn into 10,000 visitors. You see how beneficial the Content Locker is?', 'content-locker' ) ?>

<p>
